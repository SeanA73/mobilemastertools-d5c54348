## ðŸ“Š How Spaced Repetition Works

The SM-2 algorithm calculates the optimal time to review each card based on:

1. **Ease Factor** - How easy the card is for you (starts at 2.5)
2. **Interval** - Days until next review
3. **Repetitions** - How many times you've reviewed it correctly

### Review Schedule Example:
- First review: 1 day
- Second review: 6 days  
- Third review: Interval Ã— Ease Factor (e.g., 15 days)
- Mastery: 3+ successful reviews with ease factor > 2.5
