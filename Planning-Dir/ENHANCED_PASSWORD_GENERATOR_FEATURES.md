## üìä Technical Specifications

### Entropy Calculation

```
Entropy = log‚ÇÇ(charset_size ^ password_length)
```

### Time to Crack Estimation

Based on 1 billion guesses per second:
- < 60 seconds = Weak
- Hours/Days = Medium
- Years = Strong
- Millions of years = Very Strong

### Character Sets

- **Lowercase**: 26 characters (a-z)
- **Uppercase**: 26 characters (A-Z)
- **Numbers**: 10 characters (0-9)
- **Symbols**: 32 characters (!@#$%^&*()...)
- **Total**: Up to 94 characters

### Strength Scoring

Score is based on:
- Length (20 points per threshold)
- Character variety (10 points each)
- Absence of common patterns (-5 points per issue)

| Score | Level | Color |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 80-100 | Very Strong | Green |
| 60-79 | Strong | Blue |
| 40-59 | Medium | Yellow |
| 20-39 | Weak | Orange |
| 0-19 | Very Weak | Red |

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### Pattern-Based Generation

Create passwords with specific structure:
- `U` = Uppercase letter
- `L` = Lowercase letter
- `N` = Number
- `S` = Symbol
- `A` = Any character

**Examples:**
- `ULLNNS` ‚Üí `ABc12#$`
- `NNNN` ‚Üí `1234`
- `LLLLNNNN` ‚Üí `abcd5678`

### Custom Character Sets

Define your own allowed characters:
- Perfect for systems with restrictions
- Example: `abcdef0123456789` (hex only)
- Maximum flexibility

### Memorable Password Algorithm

```
Adjective + Noun + Adjective + Noun + Number
Example: Happy-Tiger-Brave-Eagle-742
```

Benefits:
- Easy to remember
- Easy to type
- Still very secure (high entropy)
- No dictionary words used directly

## üìà Security Recommendations

## üéì Educational

### Why 16+ Characters?

Modern GPUs can crack billions of passwords per second. A 16-character password with mixed types would take millions of years to brack with current technology.

### Why No Math.random()?

JavaScript's `Math.random()` is pseudo-random and predictable. We use `crypto.getRandomValues()` which is cryptographically secure.

### What is Entropy?

Entropy measures password unpredictability. Higher entropy = more secure. Aim for 60+ bits for strong passwords, 80+ for critical accounts.

### Common Password Myths

‚ùå **Myth**: Complexity requirements make passwords secure
‚úÖ **Fact**: Length is more important than complexity

‚ùå **Myth**: Changing passwords often increases security
‚úÖ **Fact**: Unique passwords + 2FA is better than frequent changes

‚ùå **Myth**: Password managers are unsafe
‚úÖ **Fact**: They're much safer than reusing or writing down passwords
