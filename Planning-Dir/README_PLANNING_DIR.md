## Purpose

These files were moved to:
1. **Clean up the project root** - Keep only essential configuration and source files in the main directory
2. **Organize documentation** - Group all planning and documentation materials in one place
3. **Maintain history** - Keep all development documentation for future reference
4. **Prepare for deployment** - Ensure only necessary files are included in production builds

## Note

These files are still tracked in Git and can be referenced or restored at any time. They contain valuable information about:
- Feature planning and implementation details
- Deployment procedures
- Development history and decisions
- Enhancement proposals

## For Deployment

When deploying the application, this entire directory can be excluded from production builds as it contains no code required for the application to run.
